## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Iguehi Akhimien. I am a third year student at the University of Toronto, studying Cognitive Science (Computational Cognition stream), Computer Science and Mathematics.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on CourseView (an app that allows students rate classes and review ratings before enrolling for a class)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot. I am in an interdiscplinary program. So, I take Psychology, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Philosophy, and Mathematics classes.
- 💬 Ask me about what it is like being a student and having so many interests!
